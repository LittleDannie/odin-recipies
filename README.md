# odin-recipies
 A Basic Recipe Website using just pure Html devoid of styles or scripts
 It consists of a home or index page containing links to three differents recipies. These Recipies open up  in another webpage which contains more details on them which includes:
  *A brief description of each recipe
  *The ingredients needed to prepare these recipie
  *The steps to take in preparing the recipies

In all of this I have been able to learn and demonstrate the use of heading tags, paragraph tags, image tags, adding an image to a webpage and adding an alternate text, linking pages together using the link tag and the href attribute, and lastly listing out the ingredients and steps using ordered and unordered list.
